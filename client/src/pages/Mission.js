         <br></br>
         <h2 style={{color: `white`}}>The initial idea behind EcoChef was to create something simple but impactful. Something that could change the way people live.</h2>
         <br></br>
         <h3 style={{color: `white`}}>We thought: why not cooking? It's fun (when you have the time). It's something we do (or should do) every day. It's something that empowers us to make a true difference. To reduce packaging and waste, to support local busineses, to eat healthy home-cooked food, to choose our ingredients wisely and protect our environment</h3>
